This document contains visual assets and design references that define the creative direction of the Pipe It!! project, inspired by the iconic game [Pipe Mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Mania).

---

The overall mood of Pipe It!! is energetic, reflecting smooth and efficient financial operations. Taking cues from Pipe Mania, which combines strategy with fluid mechanics, the design captures the project’s fast-paced, innovative approach to solving financial challenges. Bold fonts, retro pixel art, and vibrant colors evoke nostalgia while ensuring the platform remains functional and accessible. The playful typography, green neon accents, and industrial pipe imagery reinforce the "pipe" theme and highlight the platform’s direct, efficient nature in financial transactions.

The green and orange color palette reflects both the industrial pipe system (green) and a sense of urgency and action (orange), aligning with the platform’s dynamic nature. A mix of retro pixel fonts and clean, modern typography maintains a balance between playfulness and professionalism, creating an engaging and user-friendly experience that appeals to the platform’s target audience.
