### Project Name  
Pipe It!!

---

### One-liner  
Onchain invoice financing: Borrow instantly against invoices or invest and earn with AI-optimized capital allocation.

---

### Problem  
Freelancers, contractors, and service providers often wait weeks or months to get paid for completed work. In traditional finance, invoice financing is slow, opaque, and reserved for enterprises with extensive credit history. Meanwhile, DeFi lending solutions are fast, but lack real-world utility and rely solely on volatile (low LTV) crypto assets as collateral—leaving billions in invoice value untapped.

---

### Solution  
**Pipe It!!** enables instant loan issuance against on-chain invoices using the **Request Network** protocol. Invoices serve as collateral for loans issued from a **"Flooz Vault**, where idle capital is automatically allocated using an **AI agent**. Creditworthiness is assessed via a dynamic **Pipe Score**, factoring in number of invoices paid, total amount repaid, and LTV (derived from the rating). Lenders earn optimized yields. Borrowers access immediate liquidity without selling assets or waiting for clients to pay.

---

### Market Opportunity

The platfornm is charging a comission/facilitator fee of 1% from each loan issued.

### Assumptions

- **Average invoice size**: Starting at $30,000, growing to $50,000.

  - Each client factors ~10–20 invoices/year.

- **Protocol fee**: 1% on total invoice value.

  - Adoption begins in niche sectors (tech, logistics) and scales globally.
