### Project Name  
Pipe It!!

---

### One-liner  
Onchain invoice financing: Borrow instantly against invoices or invest and earn with AI-optimized capital allocation.

---

### Problem  
Freelancers, contractors, and service providers often wait weeks or months to get paid for completed work. In traditional finance, invoice financing is slow, opaque, and reserved for enterprises with extensive credit history. Meanwhile, DeFi lending solutions are fast, but lack real-world utility and rely solely on volatile (low LTV) crypto assets as collateralâ€”leaving billions in invoice value untapped.

---

### Solution  
**Pipe It!!** enables instant loan issuance against on-chain invoices using the **Request Network** protocol. Invoices serve as collateral for loans issued from a **"Flooz Vault**, where idle capital is automatically allocated using an **AI agent**. Creditworthiness is assessed via a dynamic **Pipe Score**, factoring in number of invoices paid, total amount repaid, and LTV (derived from the rating). Lenders earn optimized yields. Borrowers access immediate liquidity without selling assets or waiting for clients to pay.

### Market Opportunity

The platfornm is charging a comission/facilitator fee of 1% from each loan issued.

### Impact & Ecosystem Fit  
**Pipe It!!** bridges the $3.4T traditional invoice financing market with the Web3 economy. It brings financing invoices into DeFi, enabling safer, more relatable collateral than capital inefficient (due to low LTV) crypto tokens. We support a decentralized gig economy by giving individuals faster access to liquidity and build a DeFi future rooted in utility, transparency, and inclusion.
